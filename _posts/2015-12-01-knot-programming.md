At the first Makers Alumni talks night I gave a talk how I learned how to tie
knots on boats. It's a practical skill with elegant results, and many more ways
to put you in a bind. **Disclaimer:** this talk is not about knots. It's about
the challenges of learning by doing; about enough to keep the boat sailing.
