I delivered this talk at [Gophercon Europe 2021](https://gophercon.eu) from my desk at home. I gave a demo of the internal tooling that we use at [Form3](https://form3.tech) every day.

Form3 is growing fast in many dimensions: team size, clouds, environments, technologies, workflows, and risks. To support this growth we've built the f3 tool to streamline development. As we grow we're fostering an inner source culture where everyone can contribute plugins and packages to improve the development experience.
