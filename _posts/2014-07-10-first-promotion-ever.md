Today I had my six month review at [globaldev]. Everything has been going
pretty well, but I couldn't help feeling a little nervous and unsure what might
be store. Turns out [Sam Barnes] had a surprise for me, a promotion!

I thought that if I worked hard and made it through the first year I might
be given the nod and told: 'you're not a junior anymore'. When I worked in the
theatre industry, almost all my roles were tied to a production, so the steps
up the ladder of responsibility came when I started a new job. It's a
wonderful feeling to be valued by your team _whilst_ working with them. I'm
very grateful to everyone in the globaldev team who has helped me.

19 months ago I left the Royal Shakespeare Company. I never imagined I could
learn so much in one year.
