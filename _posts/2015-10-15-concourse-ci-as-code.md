[Henry Stanley] and I gave a talk at the London PaaS User Group ([LOPUG]), on Concourse, our beloved continuous delivery and pipelining tool. [Concourse] is a
CI system that decouples your project from all the little details of testing and delivery. It offers pipelines as first-class citizens, a clean container for
every build, and a beautiful UI.

We walked through turning CI into code, discuss how we avoid some "gotchas" with
our deployments, and demonstrated a few Concourse pipelines for continuous
delivery.
