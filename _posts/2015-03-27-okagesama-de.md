I enjoy digging into language. In particular, I like foreign words that are difficult to translate. There are some ideas we don't have a word for in English and they give me an opportunity to see the world from another perspective.

Greetings are a good place to look as they often have a depth of meaning we skate over. Recently I looked into a greeting and response from Kansai, Japan:

_Ogenki desu ka?_

> Are you well?

_Hai. okagesama de._

> Yes, thanks to you.

Hearing this gratitude reminds me of the many people I am thankful for in my life. What kindness! The response uses an interesting turn of phrase. A literal translation is 'Yes, by your _kage_'.  I was intrigued that thanks is not given for you, but your _kage_.

## Skimming the surface

I recognised the word _kage_ as shadow. I had been content with this translation for many years, but in hindsight I had missed some clues to its meaning along the way.

My first time I read the word was Akira Kurosawa's film _Kagemusha_, usually translated as _Shadow Warrior_. The story featured a thief with an uncanny resemblance to a feudal lord. In secret he was taught to impersonate the warlord. As the _kagemusha_ he became a warrior, but when he took the warlord's place he was more than a shadow .

Later I became a fan of the popular anime _Naruto_. In a fantasy world of ninja, one of young hero's favourite ninja techniques is _kagebushin no jutsu_, the shadow clone technique. _Kage_ also appears in the titles of the ninja leaders. Fire for the _Hokage_, wind for the _Kazekage_ and so on. I remember wondering what the wind's shadow might be, but let it go.

Ultimately, it wasn't until I came across _okagesama de_ that my understanding of _kage_ unravelled. Reading it as 'thanks to your shadow' I knew something was lost in translation. It was time to dig.

## _Kage_

An eloquent demonstration of the word's breadth of meaning can be made with two cases.  _Ki no kage_ is the shade of a tree and _tsuki kage_ is moonlight.

_Kage_ can attend its source like a shadow and extend from it as a reflection. As shadow and reflection _kage_ is both darkness and brightness. And each _kage_ can have a life of its own. It can fade like a photograph and distort like an old memory. It can be a lie.

> _The moon's reflection on a still pond is clear and bright. Reach in and the moon scatters from grasp, dancing across the ripples._

I am grateful to Charles Shirō Inouye for these examples. I highly recommend his translations of Izumi Kyōka's work in _Japanese Gothic Tales_ and _In Light of Shadows_ to anyone with a taste for Japan, the gothic or ghost stories.

## Lights in the dark

Sometimes I am baffled by this world's constant shifting and changing, and othertimes it seems to stand still. Nevertheless, there are people who resonate and stick in my mind. Perhaps it's not the people themselves, but their _kage_.

Like an incidental kindness that lifted my spirits, a broad smile that dissolved a conflict, a knowing laugh with a friend, or a teacher's words echoing in my ears much later. These moments shine in the dark, lighting the way.

Thanks to you.
