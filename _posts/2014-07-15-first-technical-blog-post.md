title: "My first technical blog post"
---
Today my first piece of technical writing was published on the globaldev blog.
The title is [Back-off and retry with RabbitMQ] and I learned as much about
RabbitMQ by writing the post as I did working on the Node.js service in
question. Writing is a powerful tool for understanding.
