Last year I changed career and became a beginner again. As one of the first
junior developers at [globaldev] my colleagues were curious about how I made
the change.

After hitting a glass ceiling in the theatre industry I resolved to change
course. When I met [Evgeny Shadchnev], co-founder of [Makers Academy], I was
convinced that I could learn how to code in 12 weeks.

At Makers Academy I learnt much more than I expected! It turns out that there's
a lot more to being a developer than code. The wonderful teachers at Makers
continue to inspire me today. I'm very thankful to them for giving me such a
good foundation and showing me new ways to think.

I feel like I've landed on my feet at [globaldev]. The whole team has welcomed
me and I'm especially thankful to some of the more senior developers&mdash;Paul
Bowsher, Michael Mazour, Jason Lambert and Mat Sadler&mdash;for answering my
questions carefully.

Changing career was worth the hard work. I love facing the new challenges,
playing with ideas and the environment of mutual respect. Oh, and the new
toys&hellip;retina MacBooks are beautiful :o)
