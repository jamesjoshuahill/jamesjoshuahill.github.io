Keeping your audience interested is tricky if you sound religious, so I find it hard to discuss lessons and ideas from Zen without being misunderstood.

I was inspired to share the four great vows when I heard a new version by Genjo Marinello Osho in the [Chobo-Ji podcast].

  * Care for all beings great and small animate and inanimate.
  * Dispense with our own delusions centred around our instincts for survival.
  * Allow ourselves to learn from every moment and every condition and let everything be our teacher.
  * Share our experience of open heartedness with everyone.

Last month I decided to share them with a warm crowd&mdash;the Makers at [Makers Academy]. I squeezed them onto one slide like so:

I went easy on delusion because Makers live in the unknown everyday; it's a key part of being immersed in learning how to code. If I was to present them to another audience I might say:

> Investigate the familiar and the unknown

As long as I find these four vows relevant I will revisit them everyday.

What do you think everyday?
