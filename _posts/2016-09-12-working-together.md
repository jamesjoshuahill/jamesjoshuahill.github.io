I talked about my first year of pair programming at the London Ruby User Group's [September 2016 meeting](http://lrug.org/meetings/2016/september/). I heard about pair programming a few years ago and tried it a few times. Last year, I jumped in and started pairing full-time. Working so closely with clients, colleagues, juniors and seniors was challenging. Now I enjoy pairing more than flying solo and I've seen the benefits for myself and my teammates. This talk is about the challenges and benefits of working more closely with one another.
