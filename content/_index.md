My favorite technology is human beings.

With trust and tools for collaboration, we can think better together.

I thrive in collaborative activities like pairing, workshops and retrospectives.

## Career Journey

### Managing Grid-Scale Batteries

In 2025, I was a **Senior Software Engineer at [Arenko](https://arenko.group/)**, where I worked on the core APIs that operate over 1 GW of grid-scale batteries in Great Britain.

I extended the platform to integrate with more customers and more renewable assets. It was rewarding to contribute to the energy transition and a more sustainable future.

### Enabling UK Payments at Scale

From 2020 to 2025, I worked at **[Form3](https://www.form3.tech/)**, a real-time account-to-account payment platform. I was a major contributor to rebuilding core APIs in Go that process 10x more payments with greater reliability and lower latency at p99. When I left, the platform was processing one third of UK Faster Payments.

During my time there, I served as Lead Engineer for 1.5 years, leading a team of 5 Senior Engineers during the build and scale-up of their multi-cloud platform. I captured project knowledge in documentation that became essential for many teams, and designed a Production Incident Response workshop that I delivered to over 130 engineers.

### Coaching Career Changers

I changed career by learning to code at **Makers** in 2013. Years later, I returned to help others make the same transition. I spent a year as a **Software Engineering Coach at [Makers](https://makers.tech/)** and coached over 110 learners on their journeys to becoming junior developers.

I delivered over 100 workshop sessions covering everything from debugging to test-driven development, domain modeling and agile team practices. The experience of helping people grow into their potential as engineers remains one of the most challenging and fulfilling parts of my career.

### Building Cloud Platforms

At **[Pivotal](https://tanzu.vmware.com/pivotal)** (2016 - 2019) and **CloudCredo** (2015 - 2016), I was immersed in Extreme Programming (XP) practices including pair programming, test-driven development and Lean Product principles. Pivotal's successful IPO in 2018 demonstrated the value of Cloud Foundry.

I worked on the cloud-native PaaS and services, led the Services Enablement team in developing and open-sourcing the On-Demand Service Broker, and facilitated remote-first kick-offs for teams distributed across the UK and USA. But most of all, the great people I met inspired me to become more kind to myself and to others.

## What I Enjoy

- **Technical depth**: Application development with Go, event-driven architecture, infrastructure as code and observability.
- **Collaborative mindset**: Translating complex technical requirements into clear solutions and fostering high-performing team environments.
- **Training and coaching**: From novice developers to staff engineers, helping people grow their skills and confidence.
- **Delivery focus**: Enabling teams to ship complex projects with measurable impact.
