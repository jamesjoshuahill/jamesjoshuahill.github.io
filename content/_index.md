My favorite technology is human beings. With trust and tools for collaboration, we can think better together. I thrive in collaborative activities like pairing, workshops, and retrospectives.

## Career Journey

### Managing Grid-Scale Batteries

I'm currently a **Senior Software Engineer at [Arenko](https://arenko.group/)**, where I work on the core APIs that manage over 1.1 GW of grid-scale batteries in Great Britain. It's rewarding to apply my technical skills in
real-time critical systems to the energy transition and help build a more sustainable future.

### Enabling UK Payments at Scale

From 2020 to 2025, I worked at **[Form3](https://www.form3.tech/)**, a real-time account-to-account payment platform. I was a major contributor to rebuilding core APIs in Go that process 10x more payments with greater reliability and lower latency at p99. When I left the platform was processing one third of UK Faster Payments.

During my time there, I served as Lead Engineer for 1.5 years, leading a team of 5 Senior Engineers during the build and scale-up of their multi-cloud platform. I captured project knowledge in documentation that became essential for many teams, and designed a Production Incident Response workshop that I delivered to over 130 engineers.

### Coaching Career Changers

I changed career by learning to code at **[Makers](https://makers.tech/)** in 2013. Years later, I returned to help others make the same transition. I spent a year as a **Software Engineering Coach at Makers**.

I coached 6 cohorts and over 110 learners on their journey to becoming junior developers. I delivered over 100 workshop sessions covering everything from debugging to test-driven development, domain modeling, and agile team practices. The experience of helping people grow into their potential as engineers remains one of the most challenging and fulfilling parts of my career.

### Building Cloud Platforms

At **[Pivotal](https://tanzu.vmware.com/pivotal)** (2016 - 2019) and **CloudCredo** (2015 - 2016), I was immersed in Extreme Programming (XP) practices including pair programming, test-driven development, and Lean Product principles.

I worked on cloud-native platforms and services, led the Services Enablement team in developing and open-sourcing the On-Demand Service Broker in Go, and facilitated remote-first kick-offs for teams using modern collaboration tools. But most of all
I learned how to be more kind to myself and to others.
