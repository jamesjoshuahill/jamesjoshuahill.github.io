## About Me

My favorite technology is human beings. With trust and tools for collaboration, we can think better together. I thrive in collaborative activities like pairing, workshops, and retrospectives.

Throughout my career, I've worked across diverse industries—from cloud computing to fintech, education, and now renewable energy—always focusing on enabling teams to deliver complex projects with real impact.

## Current Role

I'm currently a **Senior Software Engineer at [Arenko](https://arenko.group/)**, where I work on the core APIs that manage over 1.1 GW of grid-scale batteries in Great Britain. It's rewarding to apply my technical skills to the energy transition and help build a more sustainable future.

## Career Journey

### Enabling Payment Systems at Scale

From August 2020 to March 2025, I worked at **[Form3](https://www.form3.tech/)**, a real-time account-to-account payment platform. I was a major contributor to rebuilding core APIs in Go that process 10x more payments with greater reliability and lower latency at p99.

During my time there, I served as Lead Engineer for 1.5 years, leading a team of 5 Senior Engineers during the build and scale-up of their multi-cloud platform. I captured project knowledge in documentation that became essential for many teams, and designed a Production Incident Response workshop that I delivered to over 130 engineers.

### Coaching Career Changers

Before Form3, I spent a year as a **Software Engineering Coach at [Makers](https://makers.tech/)**, a developer bootcamp. I coached 6 cohorts and over 110 learners on their journey to becoming junior developers. I delivered over 100 workshop sessions covering everything from debugging to test-driven development, domain modeling, and agile team practices. The experience of helping people grow into their potential as engineers remains one of the most fulfilling parts of my career.

### Building Cloud Platforms

At **[Pivotal](https://tanzu.vmware.com/pivotal)** (February 2016 - May 2019) and **CloudCredo** (July 2015 - January 2016), I worked on cloud-native platforms and services. I led the Services Enablement team in developing and open-sourcing the On-Demand Service Broker in Go, and facilitated remote-first kick-offs for teams using modern collaboration tools.
